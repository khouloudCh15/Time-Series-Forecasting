# Time-Series-Forecasting
## Stock Price Forecasting
This project is a time series analysis and forecasting project on stock price data. The goal of this project is to use various models to forecast future stock prices and evaluate their performance. The project is implemented using Python and the main libraries used are pandas, numpy, matplotlib, statsmodels and sklearn.

## Data
The data used in this project is a time series data of stock prices for Tesla. The data includes the following columns:

#### Date: The date of the stock prices
#### Open: The opening price of the stock on that date
#### High: The highest price of the stock on that date
#### Low: The lowest price of the stock on that date
#### Close: The closing price of the stock on that date
## Analysis
The following steps are taken for the data analysis:

> Data preparation

> Data visualization

> Data splitting

> Time series decomposition

> Time series modeling with statistical method:

* Naive forecast
* Exponential moving average
* Simple exponential moving average (SEMA)
* ARIMA forecast

> Time series modeling with deep learning method (LSTM)

## Results
The results of the different models were compared and the best model was chosen based on the performance metric (e.g. Mean Absolute Error). The results were also visualized to help understand the performance of the models.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the importance of time series analysis and forecasting for stock prices. The different models used in this project have different strengths and weaknesses, and choosing the best model depends on the specific requirements of the project. The project also highlights the importance of data visualization and data preparation in the time series analysis.
